# AOC_2023

## What is this
This AOC_2023 repo is built whilst I am looking for a job and will contain what I hope to be solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 event (hosted here: https://adventofcode.com/2023) 
I am doing these as of now in Rust-Lang in order to learn the language as well as prepare myself for employment. I recognize that rust is probably not the best to use for these but as I said it is for practice.

### Days
1. Day 1 - Trebuchet (Complete**)
  -I used a method which involved sorting through each character or potential word and computed the number than summed the total across each line in the input.
2. Day 2 - Cube Conundrum (Complete**) 
  -Part 1 is a function that uses a deque to parse through each line and returns the value for that line
  -Part 2 uses deque but I went from back of the line to the front to dodge some issues I was having in part 1. I learned a lot about how Errors in rust worked here as well
3. Day 3 Gear Ratios (WIP)
